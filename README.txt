A simple Solidity smart contract for tipping a recipient, with an automatic fee (tax) going to the webmaster. This contract enables anyone to send tips to a specified recipient, deducting a percentage as a webmaster fee.

- Tip any recipient address.
- 30% of each tip is automatically sent to the webmaster.
- Owner can set or update the webmaster address.

## How It Works

1. **Set Webmaster:**  
   The contract owner (or any user) sets the webmaster address using `setWebmaster(address _webmaster)`.
2. **Tip a Recipient:**  
   Any user can call `tipRecipist(address _recipist)` with Ether, specifying the recipientâ€™s address.
